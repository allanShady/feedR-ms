## ðŸ’» FeedR ms
**Sample** rather **simple** .NET6 **microservices** solution which acts as the data aggregator for the different feeds.
The **purpose** of this solution is to **explore** the latest framework and **play** with different patterns, tools & libraries that can be useful when building **distributed applications**.

The overall repository structure consists of the following projects located under `src` directory:

- **Gateway** - API gateway providing a public facade for the underlying, internal services
- **Aggregator** - core service responsible for aggregating the data from different feeds
- **Notifier** - supporting service responsible for sending the notifications
- **Feeds**
  - **News** - sample feed providing the worldwide news
  - **Quotes** - sample feed providing the quotes (e.g. currency)
  - **Weather** - sample feed providing the weather related data
